# Library-Management-System
Designed and developed a comprehensive Java-based Library Management System applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. The system efficiently manages book catalogs and member data, utilizing HashMap for fast book retrieval by ISBN. It supports operations like adding, issuing, and returning books, with members able to borrow and return books seamlessly.
To optimize performance, the system implements advanced algorithms like Binary Search for quick book lookups by title in a sorted list, and Quick Sort to efficiently sort books by title. Additionally, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is applied to find the shortest path between multiple library branches, enhancing inter-branch logistics. The architecture is scalable and designed to handle a growing number of books, members, and branches, ensuring high performance in data retrieval and sorting tasks.(fixed Input)
